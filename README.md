🚀70 DSA Questions & AI Project Ideas

This repository is a structured collection of 70 essential Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions, organized topic-wise to build a strong foundation for coding interviews and problem-solving skills.
 

🧮 Arrays & Numbers

Arrays are the building blocks of programming. They store data sequentially and allow operations like searching, sorting, and manipulation.

Key Concepts:

Traversal – Visiting each element to perform actions (like sum or max/min).

Sorting – Arranging elements (ascending/descending) using algorithms like QuickSort or MergeSort.

Searching – Finding elements efficiently (Linear Search, Binary Search).

Optimization Problems – Prefix sum, sliding window, two-pointer techniques.

Example Problems:

Find max/min element

Rotate array by k positions

Find union and intersection

Majority element (> n/2 times)

Merge overlapping intervals

🧵 Strings

Strings are sequences of characters used in text processing and pattern matching.
They are heavily used in coding interviews and real-world software (like parsing, validation, encryption, etc.).

Key Concepts:

Character Counting – Vowel/consonant analysis.

Manipulation – Removing duplicates, reversing, compressing.

Comparison – Checking anagrams, rotations, or substrings.

Advanced – String hashing, pattern search (KMP, Rabin-Karp).

Example Problems:

Find first non-repeating character

Check for anagram or rotation

Longest common prefix

Generate all permutations

🔗 Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are connected via pointers.

Key Concepts:

Singly & Doubly Linked Lists – Each node contains data and one or two links.

Traversal & Modification – Insertion, deletion, reversing.

Detection & Merging – Detect loops, merge sorted lists.

Applications – Stack, queue, and polynomial representation.

Example Problems:

Reverse a linked list

Detect and remove a cycle

Find middle node

Merge two sorted lists

Check if palindrome

🧱 Stack & Queue

Stacks and Queues are abstract data types (ADTs) used for ordered data management.

Stack:

Follows LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.

Common operations: push(), pop(), top().

Queue:

Follows FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.

Common operations: enqueue(), dequeue().

Applications:

Expression evaluation

Undo/Redo functionality

Parentheses checking

Task scheduling

Example Problems:

Implement stack using queues

Evaluate postfix expression

Implement LRU cache

Check for balanced parentheses

🌳 Binary Tree & BST

Trees are hierarchical data structures used for fast searching, sorting, and organizing data.

Binary Tree:

Each node has at most two children (left & right).

Used in expression parsing, hierarchical storage, and file systems.

Binary Search Tree (BST):

A special binary tree where left < root < right.

Used in databases and search algorithms.

Example Problems:

Inorder, preorder, postorder traversals

Find tree height and diameter

Check if two trees are identical

Find Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)

Check if a tree is balanced

🌐 Graphs

Graphs represent relationships between entities using vertices (nodes) and edges (connections).
They are crucial in networking, social media, maps, and recommendation systems.

Key Concepts:

Representation – Adjacency matrix and list

Traversal – BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search)

Shortest Path – Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford

Minimum Spanning Tree – Kruskal, Prim algorithms

Cycle Detection – Directed and undirected graphs

Example Problems:

Find connected components

Implement BFS/DFS

Shortest path (BFS or Dijkstra)

Topological sorting

Detect cycles

🧠 Dynamic Programming & Recursion

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a problem-solving technique that stores intermediate results to avoid recomputation.
Recursion is used when a problem can be broken into smaller subproblems.

Key Concepts:

Overlapping Subproblems – Problems that can reuse computed results.

Optimal Substructure – Solutions built using optimal results of subproblems.

Memoization (Top-down) and Tabulation (Bottom-up) approaches.

Example Problems:

Fibonacci using memoization

0/1 Knapsack problem

Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)

Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

Minimum Edit Distance
